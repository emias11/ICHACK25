// Statement
Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true

Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false


// Questions

1. Select which of the following images represent identical trees.

- Insert here images from images/SameTree/q1-*.jpg

2. What data structure can we use to represent the tree? 

Code snippets
- List of nodes
- One should be a TreeNode with val, leftNode, rightNode
- Maybe a dictionary, ask chatgpt for some other random incorrect ones 

3. How do you want to move through the tree?

If they say recursion: 3a. What are the base cases?

If both nodes are empty. 
This is when we can pull out boilerplate, and add the base cases. 

If they say iteratively: 3b. Should you use DFS or BFS?
4b. What data structure should be used to store the nodes we visit? stack, queue 
This is where we pull out boilerplate.
